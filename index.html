            <h2>Thing #7933</h2>
            <p>
            This is Thing #7933, my first NFT.
            <br><br>
            While I purchased it after mint, I did manage to get
            it before the metadata reveal, meaning I didn't know 
            what I was getting when I first bought it.
            <br><br>
            I always liked the aesthetics of the Thingdom and,
            while a little different, I love the aesthetic of
            #7933 and feel like it stands out while remaing
            cohesive and viewable. The mint horns are somewhat
            rare and add a pop of colour to a well blending set
            of blue and golds.
            <br><br>
            As the community of communities, Things can have
            miscelanous attributes that, we think, give your
            Thing unique utility. Thing #7933 is a spellcaster,
            the rarest miscelanous trait.
